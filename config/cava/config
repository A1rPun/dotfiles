# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires a
# terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.

# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors are supported, background must also be defined in hex
# or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off. Warning: for certain terminal emulators cava will
# not able to restore color definitions on exit, simply restart your terminal to restore colors.

[smoothing]
# Percentage value for integral smoothing. Takes values from 0 - 100.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.

# Set gravity percentage for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster.
# Accepts only non-negative values. 50 means half gravity, 200 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
